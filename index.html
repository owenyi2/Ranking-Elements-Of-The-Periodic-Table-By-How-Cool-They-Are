        <h1>Ranking The Elements Of The Periodic Table By How Cool They Are</h1>
        <div>
            <p>This is a novel investigation into the material property of elements in the periodic table termned "coolness potential". Here we attempt to use an Elo scoring system to comparatively rank the elements of the periodic table. Two elements will be put side to side and you are to determine which element you believe is "cooler". The choice as to which element is "cooler" is entirely subjective. However, we hypothesise that through aggregating the opinions of many participants, we may gleam certain objective truths about how cool certain elements are compared to each other.</p>
